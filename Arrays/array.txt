Arrays:arrays are datastructure which stores a collection of homogenous items.

Representation of arrays:
int[] ages;
String[] names;
float[] weights;

syntax for array declaration:
1.int[] ages;
where ages=new int[];

2.int[] ages=new int[10];
3.String[] names=new String[20];


Array literal:

int[] age={1,25,35,45,55};

memory allocation in arrays:

int age=5;
In arrays the memory allocation will be in 2 ways,that is stacks and heap
In stacks the reference variable are going to be stored but in the case of heap actuale memory allocation will take place.
for ex:int[] age=new int[4];
now the refence of the age and the memory addreses will be stored in the stacks.
but in the heap actuale memory will be allocated.

Accessing elements in single dimensional array:
>0-indexing


Array Types:
>single dimensional
>multi dimensional

initializing 1d and 2d array:
1-D:int[] array_name=new int[];

2-D:int[][] array_name=new int[][];
          or
 int[][] array_name=new int{{}};


 Length operation in arrays:
to print the array lenth we can use(array.lenth)  


Traversing through the array:

we can use the loops to travers the array:
1.for 
2.while
3.for each
